# Editing your docs

The Doctave desktop app is used to preview what your documentation will look like once published.

You are looking at your content rendered in **realtime**. Any changes you make in your project will be reflected immediately.
You can see information about the page you are currently viewing on the top left of the app.

## Making changes

You can use your text editor of choice to edit your documentation. Usually, people will have their editor open on one side of the screen, with the Doctave app open next to it.

{% capture content %}
Try editing this file, `guides/README.md`, file in your favourite text editor and see what happens! ðŸš€
{% endcapture %}
{% include "_partials/callout.html" content: content, kind: "info" %}

Doctave supports standard CommonMark Markdown, with common extensions like tables enabled.

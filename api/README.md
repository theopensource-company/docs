# OpenAPI documentation

Doctave can generate API reference documentation from your OpenAPI specification.

![Doctave supports OpenAPI](/_assets/openapi.png)

This is an example project with a simple OpenAPI specification included.

{% capture content %}
âœ… Try editing `openapi-example.yaml` to see how Doctave renders the different parts of the OpenAPI specification, or replace the contents of the file with your own spec!
{% endcapture %}
{% include "_partials/callout.html" content: content, kind: "info" %}
